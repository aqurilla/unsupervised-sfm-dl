The training code is run as follows-

python train.py --dataset_dir=/home/paperspace/Desktop/P4/TrainingAndValData/SfMLearnerData/ --checkpoint_dir=/home/paperspace/Desktop/P4/SfMLearner-master/checkpoints/2/ --img_width=416 --img_height=128 --batch_size=4

Changes were made in SfMLearner.py, nets.py and data_loader.py as explained in the report. Filenames were kept the same in order to run with the program.
